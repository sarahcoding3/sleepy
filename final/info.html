	<div class="ptext"><p>Ever wake up groggy, cranky and head still swimming even after eight hours of sleep? You may be waking in the middle of a sleep cycle! <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-calculator" target="_blank">Sleep cycles</a> repeat every 90 - 120 minutes and a few times per night. Instead of eight hours, try setting your alarm for 7 hours and 30 minutes, or have a longer rest at 9 hours.</p></div>
	<div class="ptext"><p>I tried sleeping like this for a few weeks and felt an immediate difference. I was waking up without a fight, feeling alert and well rested. It gave me momentum to start my day. I used a sleep calcuator, many of which you can find online to calculate what time I should wake up, or what time I should turn in for the night. My favorite seems to be <a href="https://sleepcalculator.com/" target="_blank">Sleepcalculator.com's </a> calculator as it accounts for the time it takes an average person to fall asleep. If you find it harder to drift off, account for that in your own bed-time calculations! My last piece of advice is to try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every morning and night, something I experimented with in my <a href="routinereview.html">sleep experiments</a>.</p></div>

	<div class="ptext"><p> If these sleep tips fail you, or you have no idea what's going wrong, keep track of your sleep for a couple weeks. This can help you identify habits that might be keeping you tired in the morning and wide-awake at night. Keeping track of this can also be an invaluable tool when seeking medical advice for sleep-related issues. Here is a form from the NIH to get you started.</p>
		
	
	
	<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/sleep-diary" target="_blank">printable link</a> to their website.  It brings you through a few important things such as the time you went to sleep and woke up every morning, caffeine and alcohol usage, excercise, and naptimes, which are all important variables to consider when wondering about your sleep quality. It also includes some quality of sleep metrics such as how long it took you to sleep, how many times you woke up during the night, and how sleepy you felt during the day. These are important to pay attention to and consider if you think you may have a sleep disorder as they fall under common symptoms for conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631" target="_blank">sleep apnea</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497" target="_blank">narcolepsy</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167" target="_blank">insomnia</a>. </p>
