	<p><b>For those that have trouble sleeping,</b> every part of it is a struggle. Falling asleep might take you hours and leave you tossing and turning in an uncomfortable environment not suited for a good night. If you manage, staying asleep may be your next hurdle. Light sleepers may jolt awake at every little noise or spot of light, or worse case, you could be awaken by absolutely nothing at all except for your own body. The last stage of this torturous process is waking up. This is what many people who struggle with sleeping fear the most. Bleary eyes mixed with a swimming head and the frustration of waking up on the wrong side of the bed is the perfect formula for cranky mornings and a day full of nodding off at your desk.</p>
	<p>I've lived through all of this, and have committed to finding things that would put an end to this overnight struggle. Here are the items and actions that I found help me fall asleep, keep me asleep, and wake me up without a panic.</p>

	<h3 id="sec-sleep"> Things that knock me out</h3>
	<p>Journalling has been widely discussed in many wellness circles and as a bit of a skeptic, I didn't really believe it. I thought it would be a waste of the very little time I seem to have as a student. I decided to start keeping a small bedside journal with a pen stuck in the included elastic loop on a whim, and try out writing my thoughts before bed every night. Surprisingly it helped! It allowed me time and space to sort out my thoughts and conflicts for the day before I was fully tucked in so I didn't have to worry about it while the lights were off. </p>
<p> Lighting a candle contribues to this process. By choosing a calming, floral scent instead of a bright citrus, you can prepare your body to fully relax into your bedtime routine.</p>
	<p>For nights where nothing helps, turning on an ASMR video helps a lot. This can be pulled up on any device and flipped over to get rid of any light it exudes. My favorite ASMR lately seems to be this guy that carves heiroglyphics into a wax tablet while quietly explaining the sounds each picture makes. </p>

	<h3 id="sec-stay"> Things that keep me asleep</h3>
	<p> There's nothing better than earplugs and a eyemask to keep you asleep. Neighbors or siblings screaming in the middle of the night can be easily ignored, and you can sleep through the piercing light streaming through your blinds at six in the morning by covering your eyes without installing an expensive blackout curtain, especially in a rental. </p>

	<h3 id="sec-wake"> Things that help me be a better person when I'm awake</h3>
	<p> I, like many others, wake up cranky. However, with these items, I feel like I can be a little kinder to those I encounter. A real, physical alarm clock that is dependable enough to wake you up every morning is extremely helpful. I have turned off my phone alarm in fear of the software malfunctioning, but this digital alarm clock had never let me down. </p>
	<p>Careful with supplements! This website offers no real medical advice. Ashwagahda supplements give off a pleasant enough placebo effect to me that make me feel calmer. Does it actually work? Who really knows?</p>
