			<p>Sleeping is an essential factor in our lives. We only get 7-9 hours to recharge for the day that awaits us, but many people get much less. Poor sleep quality, a shorter duration than needed, and frequent awakenings can lead to catastrophic side effects, both in the short and long run. This usually results in daytime drowsiness, irritability, poor focus, and much more for those whose nights are full of tossing and turning instead of solid rest.  </p>
			<p>Taking control of your sleep habits to improve its quality is essential. At Dreamcatcher, you can find true and tested advice for all kinds of sleep-related issues from busy people just like you. From reviews of viral products to collections of sleep-related items, you can rest assured that we understand how tired you are of feeling exhausted and are here to make it a bit better. Disclaimer: seek all medical advice from a trained professional. </p>
