<p> <b>I bought a pack of <a href="https://casper.com/blogs/article/sleep-mask-benefits" target="_blank"> sleep masks</a> </b>after deciding that my journey to getting better sleep was my own issue, and should not affect those around me. BeeVines has a pack of two pure silk eye masks on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08817H6HS?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, bought at $7.30 during a special spring sale that Amazon was holding. Their regular price is listed at $14.95, an incredible 51% discount. Upon receiving them, I noticed their quality. They were thick, padded well with a material and made on both sides with what they are claiming is 100% natural mulberry silk. They are smooth and cool to the touch, two very important properties for a good quality eye mask to have. The straps are elastic as well as adjustable, and easy to fit around your head and fix to an appropriate size. It completely blocks out light when you put it on, although some light escapes through the space created by the bridge of your nose. This may be a <a href="https://chromakode.com/post/sleep-masks/" target="_blank"> physiological </a>problem as everyone’s noses are shaped differently. </p></div>

<p><b>Sleeping with the mask on is an interesting experience</b> if you’re not used to it. Pulling it over your eyes, your brain still knows that the lights are on around you even if it is being blocked by a mask. This takes some time getting used to. My favorite, silly trick to combat this is to cover your head with your blanket, then remove it. Your brain should adjust afterwards, knowing that in lightness or in dark, the darkness you experience with the mask on is the same. Additionally, the mask seems to slip off in the middle of the night no matter how tightly I adjust the strap. However, if I pull it too tight, it affects the comfortability of my sleep. I wonder if I am yanking it off of my head in the middle of the night. You may run the risk of feeling too restricted. It’s a strange feeling to be so suddenly cocooned if you are used to not sleeping with one at all. </p>
<p><b>The benefit outweighs the fault,</b> however, as I am now able to go to sleep at whatever time I want without bothering my roommate about it. She can stay up studying later into the night, even if I choose to go to bed at 10 PM on a weekend night. This eliminates a problem for both of us, giving both of us the convenience of choice for our respective needs. Overall, I recommend these sleep masks if you are looking for a convenient and cheap option. Of course, there are much more <a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/can-the-manta-sound-sleep-mask-improve-your-rest-i-tested-it-to-find-out/">expensive</a> and higher quality options available on the market that may eliminate some of the problems that I encountered using these, but the BeeVines sleep masks work well enough for my needs. </p>
