	<div class="ptext"><p><b>For those that have trouble sleeping,</b> every part of it is a struggle. Falling asleep might take you hours and leave you tossing and turning in an uncomfortable environment not suited for a good night. If you manage, staying asleep may be your next hurdle. Light sleepers may jolt awake at every little noise or spot of light, or worse case, you could be awaken by absolutely nothing at all except for your own body. The last stage of this torturous process is waking up. This is what many people who struggle with sleeping fear the most. Bleary eyes mixed with a swimming head and the frustration of waking up on the wrong side of the bed is the perfect formula for cranky mornings and a day full of nodding off at your desk.</p>
	<p>I've lived through all of this, and have committed to finding things that would put an end to this overnight struggle. Here are the items and actions that I found help me fall asleep, keep me asleep, and wake me up without a panic, as well as activities to do before bed that don't expose you to blue light that could keep you awake.</p>

	<h4 id="sec-sleep"> Things that knock me out</h4>
	
	<div class="gallery-grid">

	</div>
	<div class="ptext"><p>Journalling has been widely discussed in many wellness circles and as a bit of a skeptic, I didn't really believe it. I thought it would be a waste of the very little time I seem to have as a student. I decided to start keeping a small bedside journal with a pen stuck in the included elastic loop on a whim, and try out writing my thoughts before bed every night. Surprisingly it helped! It allowed me time and space to sort out my thoughts and conflicts for the day before I was fully tucked in so I didn't have to worry about it while the lights were off. </p>
<p> Lighting a candle contribues to this process. By choosing a calming, floral scent instead of a bright citrus, you can prepare your body to fully relax into your bedtime routine.</p>
	<p>For nights where nothing helps, turning on an ASMR video helps a lot. This can be pulled up on any device and flipped over to get rid of any light it exudes. My favorite ASMR lately seems to be this guy that carves heiroglyphics into a wax tablet while quietly explaining the sounds each picture makes. </p>

	</div>
	
	<div class="ptext"><p> There's nothing better than earplugs and a eyemask to keep you asleep. Neighbors or siblings screaming in the middle of the night can be easily ignored, and you can sleep through the piercing light streaming through your blinds at six in the morning by covering your eyes without installing an expensive blackout curtain, especially in a rental. </p>

	</div>
	
	<div class="ptext"><p> I, like many others, wake up cranky. However, with these items, I feel like I can be a little kinder to those I encounter. A real, physical alarm clock that is dependable enough to wake you up every morning is extremely helpful. I have turned off my phone alarm in fear of the software malfunctioning, but this digital alarm clock had never let me down. </p>
	<p>Careful with supplements! This website offers no real medical advice. Ashwagahda supplements give off a pleasant enough placebo effect to me that make me feel calmer. Does it actually work? Who really knows?</p>

	<h4 id="sec-activities">Bedtime Activies that don't expose you to blue light</h4>
	<div class="ptext"><p>It's known and commonly spoken that exposure to blue light keeps you awake. Experts constantly warn against phone usage too close to bedtime, and suggest parents to limit their children's screentime a few hours before bed. Phones and laptops come with built-in blue light filters to lower this exposure, but still, the best method is to eliminate all use a few hours before bed as best as you can. But what can you do during this no-phone time? Here are some suggestions! </p></div>
	
	<div class="ptext"><p> Writing about your day in a <b>journal </b>can help clear your mind. You can write anything. I have found that writing about things that bothered me as well as things that will worry me help immensely in putting things in a tangible form and making it real. This way, troubles can be directly dealt with instead of having them simmer inside your mind, tossing and turning with you during bedtime.</p></div>
	
	<div class="ptext"><p><b>Painting a picture</b> is extremely relaxing, no matter what skill level you're at. The smooth feeling of a brush gliding through paint on canvas slows your thinking and helps you focus singlemindedly on a task. You don't have to be great at painting, or paint something particularly profound. I think sushi looks cute so I made a small painting with my friend before bed.</p></div>
		
	<div class="ptext"><p><b>Folding origami </b> gives a similar effect in a completely different way. By using your brain and creating something tangible in front of you, the satisfaction is both fun and relaxing. You can find many fun printouts to keep around for bedtime as well as buy a stack of origami paper to fold with.</p></div>
		
	<div class="ptext"><p>I'm a big advocate for <b>reading </b>as it improves your brain health, memory, attention span, and helps you sleep better. It also increases your vocabulary and your emotional intelligence by leaps and bounds. There's no wonder why it is one of the most popular bedtime activies.</p></div>
	
	<div class="ptext"><p>If you don't want to pull out equipment and complicated paperworks, <b>doodling </b> is equally fun and relaxing. It keeps your hands busy, while entertaining you just enough that you can do this with other activities such as talking to a friend, or listening to a tape.</p></div>
	
	
	<div class="ptext"><p>With modern listening devices being centered around screens, the beauty of <b>listening to music</b> on a device made for just that can't be forgotten. By pulling out your favorite CDs, cassettes, or records, you can have a relaxing night, focusing just on the sounds of your favorite tunes. </p></div>
