	My Wind-down Routine</div> <div class="smallinfo"> Written by Sarah C. | April 24th, 2025</div>

	<div class="ptext"><p>One of the best and most often given advice among sleep experts, is to have a good wind-down routine. This alternative name for a bedtime routine lets your body know it's about to get rest, and makes you sleepy enough to fall asleep without much issue. Like all habits, it takes time to build, so finding a routine that works for you, and that you enjoy doing, is the best. Here's a small insight into my nightly routine.</p></div>
	
	<h4>1. Go for a walk</h4>
	<img src="images/walk.jpg" width="900px" class="centered-image" alt="Skyview of a walk around campus"> <div class="caption">Skyview of a walk around campus</div>
		<div class="ptext"><p>Getting a little bit of excercise before bed can help you relax. Doing strenous cardio or heavy weightlifting may be too exiciting and make it harder for you to sleep, so a nice, easy walk around your neighborhood would do the trick. Try this with a friend and build a habit to promote heart health along the way. Additionally, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/exposure-to-natural-light-during-the-day-may-help-you-sleep-better" target="_blank">exposure to natural light</a> can help you regulate your circadian rhythm!</p></div>
	
	<h4>2. Learn something</h4>
	<img src="images/orgo.jpg" width="900px" class="centered-image" alt="Picture of my Organic Chemistry notebook"> <div class="caption">My Organic Chemistry notebook</div>
	<div class="ptext"><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0467-3" target="_blank">Long-term memory</a> forms during sleep, so getting a bit of studying before bed can benefit both your grades, and your health. By tiring out your brain a little, your sleep will feel much more satisyfing. Make sure not to work too close to bedtime, however, as stress can <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/05/night-owl-behavior-could-hurt-mental-health--sleep-study-finds.html" target="_blank">negatively impact</a> your sleep quality.</p></div>
	
	<h4> 3. Eat a good dinner</h4>
	<img src="images/dinner.jpg" width="900px" class="centered-image" alt="Rice bowl with egg, tuna, and avocado"> <div class="caption">Rice bowl with egg, tuna, and avocado</div>
	<div class="ptext"><p>Eating a fulfilling, nutrient-rich dinner a few hours before bed gives you enough time to digest. My favorite dinner to make is a quick and easy rice bowl with vegetables and proteins. It is generally <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/is-it-bad-to-eat-before-bed" target="_blank">reccomended</a> to finish eating two to four hours before your bedtime. </p></div>
	
	<h4> 4. Read a book</h4>
	<img src="images/book.jpg" width="900px" class="centered-image" alt="On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong"> <div class="caption">On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong</div>
	<div class="ptext"><p>Reading before bed can help you relax, settle into your routine, and prevent degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimers in the long run. My current pick is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880609-on-earth-we-re-briefly-gorgeous" target="_blank">On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</a> by Ocean Vuong, a book I'm reading with my book club.</p></div>
	
	<h4> 5. Do some self-care</h4>

	<div class="ptext"><p>Washing my face and doing my skincare makes me sleepy immediately. While cells repair and turn over during the night, I like to take full advantage of this biological process by giving my skin everything it needs. My current line-up consists of an oil-based cleanser to remove my makeup, a water-based cleanser to remove dirt and sweat, a toner to balance my skin's pH, and a moisturizer to lock everything in and keep it hydrated.</p><p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p></div>

	<div class="ptext"><p> If these sleep tips fail you, or you have no idea what's going wrong, keep track of your sleep for a couple weeks. This can help you identify habits that might be keeping you tired in the morning and wide-awake at night. Keeping track of this can also be an invaluable tool when seeking medical advice for sleep-related issues. Here is a form from the NIH to get you started.</p>
